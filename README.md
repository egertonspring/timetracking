A little GUI tool written in python which can help you tracking your working time.
This version is optimized for Ubuntu 22.10 with a current python 3 version and a current tkinter version.

Please install Tkinter for that:

sudo apt install python3-tk
or
pip3 install tkinter

This will not look good on a macOS Ventura because of a highly outdated version of Tkinter
